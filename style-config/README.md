# Intersmash - Code style configuration assets

This submodule holds configuration assets that are used by the Spotless Maven plugin, in order to 
manage checkstyle (formatting, import, license headers etc.) in the project modules via a Maven dependency.

This approach has been introduced in the Spotless Maven plugin to [handle multiple module projects](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/210#issue-299539353).
