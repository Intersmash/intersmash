### Operator-based provisioning

The Intersmash Library provides support for operator-based provisioning, i.e. it automates the behavior needed to deploy
a given service on cloud environments via APIs that leverage the
[Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework).

Intersmash makes this feature available for currently supported products (see the table below), but that can be
extended easily, since Intersmash _provisioners_ are pluggable components.

| Service                          | Supported Operator version | Channel name | Repository                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Intersmash operator-based provisioners implement a common contract and high level behavior which is defined by the
[OperatorProvisioner](../core/src/main/java/org/jboss/intersmash/provision/openshift/operator/OperatorProvisioner.java)
class.
